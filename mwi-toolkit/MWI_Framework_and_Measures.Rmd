:::

The MWI framework contains three domains and two dynamic factors:

-   Domains:
    -   Social Determinants of Health
    -   Healthcare Access
    -   Health Status
-   Dynamic Factors
    -   Structural Racism
    -   Community and Cultural Assets

### Domains and Sub-Domains

The three domains in the MWI framework are: Social Determinants of Health, Healthcare Access, and Health Status. These are distinct and influence one another (they do not overlap). Each domain includes a set of measures, each measure belongs to a single domain.

1.  **Social Determinants of Health:** the social, economic, environmental, and structural conditions that influence a community's mental wellness and quality of life.[^1] There are 15 measures in this domain, organized under the following sub-domains:
    -   **Built Environment:** The physical parts of where people live and work, such as easy access to parks and having broadband access.[^2]
    -   **Education Success:** Ability to receive formal education and to achieve graduation outcomes.
    -   **Income & Employment:** Income earned in comparison to the federal poverty level and employment status.[^3]
    -   **Housing:** Living space affordability, quality, and economic and racial/ethnic spatial polarization.
    -   **Social Capital:** Refers to the resources to which individuals and groups have access through their social networks. These social networks could be at the personal, public, professional, and other levels. When these networks intersect the value of these connections increases, increasing the overall social capital.[^4]
    -   **Safety and Community Trauma:** Safety refers to factors contributing to community members living in peace, harmony, and mutual respect,[^5] while community trauma refers to experiences by community members that have structural and social traumatic consequences.[^6]
    -   **Financial Access:** Availability and affordability of financial services for individuals in a community.[^7] <br>
2.  **Healthcare Access:** Access to traditional healthcare systems, accounting for quality, financial, geographic, and other considerations. There are 3 measures in this domain, organized under the following sub-domains:
    -   **Treatment Facilities:** Access to physical locations providing appropriate medical treatment.
    -   **Health Insurance:** Service covering some or all health and medical costs. <br>
3.  **Health Status:** mental health, substance use, and other morbidity and mortality measures that are linked to mental wellness. There are 10 measures in this domain, organized under the following sub-domains:
    -   **Substance Use:** Mortality from and frequency of substance use behaviors at a community level.
    -   **Mental Health:** Emotional, psychological, and social well-being of communities.[^8]
    -   **Other Morbidity and Mortality:** Other forms of morbidity and mortality correlated with mental wellness. <br>

### Dynamic Factors

*Community & Cultural Assets* and *Structural Racism* acknowledge the positive and negative influences of human factors that influence outcomes and the distribution of assets and obstacles for measures in all three domains:

**Community & Cultural Assets:** Resources in the form of people, places, and organizations that promote social connection and improve the health and wellbeing of the community.[^9] [^10]

Community & cultural assets influence all measures in the MWI. Community & cultural assets are challenging to quantify because they are often not measured in national datasets, but they have an important influence on community mental wellness. One example of a measure where community and cultural assets can be seen prominently is "third places," which measures the number of places where people spend time outside of their homes ("first place") and their workplaces ("second place"), per 100,000 people.

**Structural Racism:** The macrolevel systems, social forces, institutions, ideologies, and processes that interact with one another to generate and reinforce inequities among racial and ethnic groups.[^11]

Structural racism influences all measures in the MWI. Structural racism harms society as a whole, not only Black populations and other people of color. Structural racism operates on many levels, often intersecting with other "isms" (sexism, classism, etc.) and has cascading effects that are often unnamed and seemingly unnoticed. These cascading effects highlight the importance of our approach for developing the MWI---that equity delivered to historically marginalized populations will accrue to others and potentially catalyzes movement toward social and racial justice. One example of a measure where structural racism can be seen prominently is the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (a proxy for residential segregation).

Studies show that poor mental health leads to low voter turnout, especially when potential voters experience social isolation or stigma related to their mental health. Substance use--- including smoking, drinking, and drug use---is also associated with lower voter turnout.[^40] Also, it has been shown that civic engagement is related to positive mental health and health behaviors.[^41]                                                                                                                                            |

Travel distance to a treatment facility is an important indicator of access to and use of treatment, particularly for populations that are underserved. Distance from a substance use treatment facility greatly impacts the length of a patient's stay and their likelihood of completing treatment. It is essential to understand the relative distance people in a certain community must travel to access substance use treatment.[^47] |

Therefore, a high alcohol-related mortality rate may indicate a significant number of people with untreated AUD.[^50]                                                                              |

For instance, it can be a sign of poor environment. Some people who have experienced trauma may be at higher risk of developing obesity. People who are overweight may also experience additional social negative pressure associated with being overweight, taking a mental toll. Also, medications used to treat mental health issues may lead to obesity.[^59] |

**How were the measures for the MWI selected?**

To select measures to include in the MWI, MITRE leveraged data and expertise from existing efforts MITRE is supporting on health equity and public health; researched factors associated with mental wellness based on national and community studies; and engaged with external subject matter experts, community key informants, public health organizations, and potential users.

**Measure selection criteria** that were considered during measure selection are shown below:

-   **Data Availability:** Measures were limited to topics for which nationally available, public data are available at a geographically granular level (ideally the ZIP Code level or lower).

-   **Equity**: The measure captures inequities between populations, value group differences, and is built on best science and community experience without introducing bias. The measures is in line with a "do-no-harm" approach.

-   **Importance**: The measure is an important indicator of mental wellness, supported by a consensus of evidence in literature.

-   **Relevance and Usability**: The measure provides meaningful information, understandable, and useful for decision-making. It conveys a sense of the obligation to act.

-   **Scientific Soundness**: The measure has sufficient specificity, reliability, and validity.

-   **Feasibility**: The data for the measure is up-to-date and available on a timely basis.

> NOTE: Though race stratified data are not available for all measures in the MWI, preference was given in the selection process to measures with data that can be stratified by race for Black populations. For data that is stratified by Black populations, the measure is calculated for both Black populations and the overall population (see measure documentation for more information on these calculations). For data that cannot be stratified, the overall population values are used for both calculations. Some measures that strongly aligned with the measure evaluation and selection criteria (see below) were included even though they could not be stratified by race.
