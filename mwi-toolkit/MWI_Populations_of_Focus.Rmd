The MWI provides results and data for Black populations and the overall population, down to the ZIP code level.

Black populations were prioritized as the first group of interest in part for the following reasons:

-   Black populations have similar or lower prevalence of adverse mental health and substance use outcomes compared to the overall population in national datasets, [^1] [^2] but they often experience a greater burden of disease and poorer access to and quality of care. [^3] [^4] [^5]

-   Black populations experience more criminalization of mental health and substance use disorders than other racial and ethnic groups.[^6] [^7]

-   Racial and ethnic minority groups who have borne disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 exposure---including Black populations---are more recently experiencing higher rates of mental health symptoms and the use of substances to cope.[^8] [^9]

By focusing on underserved and under-resourced communities, the MWI "centers at the margins" or normalizes the perspectives and experiences of non-White racial and ethnic groups. MITRE recognizes that equity delivered to historically underserved populations will accrue to others. This will in turn promote social and racial justice. MITRE hopes to make the data viewable for other groups experiencing health disparities in the future.
