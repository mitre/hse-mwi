# Mental Wellness Index™ (MWI)

The Mental Wellness Index is a framework and dashboard tool that provides a picture of community-level mental wellness for each zip code\* in the nation. The MWI is comprised of 28 measures from 3 domains: Social Determinants of Health, Healthcare Access, and Health Status. Structural Racism and Community & Cultural Assets are woven around and throughout the domains of the MWI itself, reflecting their influence throughout the measure framework.

The intent of the Mental Wellness Index is to provide a snapshot of a community's mental wellness so that community leaders, public health officials, and funding entities can understand how they might best direct mental health support to build on a particular community's assets and fill in its gaps.

\*ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)

## MWI Domains & Measures

The MWI creates a score for each zip code between 0 and 100, such that:

-   higher values indicate more **assets** that **support** community mental wellness

-   lower values indicate more **obstacles** that **challenge** community mental wellness

^ indicates measures that are race stratified

## Focus on Black Americans

The MWI was developed with the mental health status of Black Americans in mind. We selected Black Americans as a priority population in order to center at the margins and avoid creating an index that is focused to the 'average community.'  We believe that focusing on Black Americans in this way allows all groups experiencing disparities to benefit because none of us are well until all of us are well. We also recognize the need to identify, recognize, and adapt the MWI for additional priority populations.

# Technical Set Up

## Data Pipeline

![](www/media/Data%20Pipeline.png)

## Data Sync

Sync Microsoft Teams BHN Score Creation folder into your local The MITRE Corporation (One-Drive) folder

## Finalize Measures

Measure Tracking document located in `Teams` \> `BHN Score` \> `Measure-Tracking.xslx`

Refer to and update this document when additional measures are finalized.

## Pulling Data

Add data pulled from an API or directly downloaded from a website will fall into one of the two folders:

-   `Teams` \> `BHN Score` \> `Data` \>`Raw`

    -   if any measure calculation needs to be completed (i.e. point geography to container geography, prevalence calculations, etc.)

    -   file extension is can also be .xlsx, .csv, .dta, etc

-   `Teams` \> `BHN Score` \> `Data` \>`Preprocessed`

    -   if data falls into a format where each row is a geographic container (i.e. Census Tract, County, ZIP Code, etc.)

    -   file extension is .csv only

    -   **Note:** For any data pulled from an API (tidycensus, etc.), perform any pre-processing tasks and write data directly to `Preprocessed` folder.

When pulling data, make sure to fill out relevant columns in the `Measure-Tracking.xlsx` and / or `Metadata.xlsx` files.

## Measure Registration

Measure Registration document in `Teams` \> `BHN Score` \>`Data` \> `Metadata.xslx` . This document provides information required for batch processing / batch analysis from Pre-Processed data to Clean data.

### Pre-Processed Data

This file contains information on all **pre-processed** measures and informs any additional transformations that need to occur between pre-processing and cleaned data, including:

-   Any geographic level -\> ZCTA level only

-   Measure directionality aligned (higher values indicate higher need)

-   Scaling aligned (fractions to percents 0.1 -\> 10(%), prevalence adjustments (per 1000 people), etc.)

### Cleaned Data

Once data is cleaned, they will be merged into the Combined Measures file. There will be two versions:

-   Original combined measures file: `Teams` \> `BHN Score` \>`Data` \> `Cleaned` \> `HSE_ZCTA_Converted_Measures.csv`

-   Percentile Scaled combined measures file: `Teams` \> `BHN Score` \>`Data` \> `Cleaned` \> `HSE_ZCTA_Percentile_Ranked_Measures.csv`

In addition, information about data (amount missing, number of nonmissing rows, etc.) is generated and appears in: `Teams` \> `BHN Score` \>`Data` \> `Cleaned` \> `HSE_BHN_Data_Information.csv`.

### Analysis

With Combined Measure files, we will perform the following analyses:

-   Covariance analysis (flagging and managing variable sets with high multi-collinearity)

-   Missingness analysis (identifying measures with high multiple missing values, identifying ZCTAs with multiple missing measures)

-   Cross-Validation with other composite measures (COI, UNS, CHR, SVI, etc.)

### Documentation

Measure documentation can be found in `Teams` \> `BHN Score` \>`Documentation` folder.

## Weights

We will create 3 sets of weights files:

-   Parsimonious weighting (All equal weights)

-   Child Opportunity Index weighting determination method

-   County Health Rankings weighting

## Score Creation

Final scores for each ZCTA will be created by combining the weights and combined measures file. Measures and measure weights are multiplied together, summed for each ZCTA, and then re-scaled from 0 to 100. Scores appear (with percentile ranked measures) in `Teams` \> `BHN Score` \>`Data` \> `Cleaned`:

-   Total Population Score: `HSE_BHN_ZCTA_Score_Black.csv`

-   Black Population Score: `HSE_BHN_ZCTA_Score_Population.csv`
